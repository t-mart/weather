WEATHER
by Tim Martin 902396824, 2015-03-31

weather is a package containing source code for 2 objects: server and client.
They are described in detail in their respective file headers.

BUILDING:
  %> make build
  or a simple "make" will do.

  This creates 2 executables. You must have gcc and the pthreads library
  accessible.

RUNNING:
  %> ./server
    (This must come first!)

  In another terminal on the same machine,
  %> ./client

BEHAVIOR:
  Running server will start the server on all local interfaces at port 7144.
  Logging will begin to a log file at the same path as the server, called
  "weather.log".

  Subsequently, running client will make a connection to server and print the
  current time of the server host to stdout.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
  server:
